# ðŸš€ Website Optimization Summary - OSIM MTsN 1 Makassar

## âœ… Completed Optimizations

### 1. **Parallax Animations** ðŸŽ¨
Successfully integrated multiple parallax effects throughout the website:

#### a. **Hero Section Parallax**
- Added parallax effect to hero content with `data-speed` attributes
- Text and hero image move at different speeds during scroll
- Creates depth and visual interest

#### b. **Element-Based Parallax**
- Applied to cards, sections, and content blocks
- Different parallax speeds (0.1-0.5) for layered effect
- Smooth transforms using `translate3d` for GPU acceleration

#### c. **Image Parallax on Hover**
- Gallery images scale on hover (110%)
- Smooth transitions for professional look
- Enhanced user interaction

### 2. **Gallery Show/Hide Functionality** ðŸ“¸
- **Default State**: Shows only 8 images initially
- **Load More Button**: Reveals hidden gallery items with smooth animation
- **Toggle Feature**: Button text changes to "Sembunyikan" (Hide) when expanded
- **Scroll Back**: Auto-scrolls to gallery section when hiding items
- **Prevents Long Scrolling**: Users don't need to scroll through dozens of images unless they want to

### 3. **Performance Optimizations** âš¡

#### a. **Lazy Loading**
```html
loading="lazy" - Applied to all images except hero/above-fold content
loading="eager" - First 3 hero slideshow images for instant display
```

#### b. **WebP Image Format**
- All images use WebP format (already available in your folders)
- Significantly smaller file sizes compared to PNG/JPG
- Better compression with maintained quality

#### c. **Optimized CSS**

- Efficient event delegation

#### e. **Resource Hints**
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://unpkg.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
```
Speeds up connection to external resources

### 4. **Scroll-Triggered Animations** ðŸ“œ
